ClusterATAC is a Cancer subtype tool based on ATAC-seq profiles. The input for the framework high-dimensional ATAC-peak scores of all the tumor samples. The output is the corresponding subclass label for each sample. ClusterATAC is mainly divided into two components: 1. GAN-based feature extraction module, which is used to obtain abstract features from deep learning using high-dimensional original input. 2. A GMM-based clustering module for determining the number of types and the class labels corresponding to each sample. ClusterATAC is based on the python language. The input sample file is ‘samples.txt’. The output sample file is ‘TCGA_ATAC_peak_Log2Counts_dedup_sample.clusteratac’.
